<p>Andante in 5/4 (3 beats followed by 2), with no expression markings</p>
<p>Opening melody is harmonically ambiguous and given to a solo flute ghosted by bass flute a sixth below</p>
<p>Tremolo in 1st &amp; 2nd Harp on the same chord written enharmonically (Gsharp minor/Aflat minor). The chords are played on different strings so can be oscillated from one to another</p>
<p>Strings enter muted (Con Sordino) with celeste chords and the opening melodic material is converted into accompanying texture</p>
<p>Composite held chords of Emin/Emajor in trumpets and Trombones with arpeggiated textures in strings and harps</p>
<p>Trills and tremolos in strings with scalic passages in celeste. From this point melodic shape disappears and is replaced by pure texture and slow moving harmony.</p>
<p>Sul Ponticello tremolando in strings (the bow played close to the bridge producing a more scratchy harsh texture), followed by composite chords in brass accompanying florid complex textures in celeste, harps and upper strings</p>
<p>Pianissimo Bass Drum stroke with composite chords in wind colored by sul ponticello in strings and the entry of the celeste in quintiplets starting at various points in the bar leading to the listener not knowing where the measures start and finish</p>
<p>Harps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glissando">glissando</a> in contrary motion underpinned by a composite chord of Emajor/min</p>
<p>The off-stage wordless choir enter for the first time a held top G accompanying the first truly melodic idea since the opening of the movement played by solo clarinet, followed by 1st Violins without their mutes</p>
<p>The choir of female voices breaks into six parts of weaving wordless counterpoint in Emajor accompanied very sparsely by harp harmonics and very low and quiet flute chords</p>
<p>The orchestra comes to the fore using virtuosic complex textures of scalic and arpeggiated patterns in harps, celeste and strings, with composite chords in woodwind and brass</p>
<p>The choir re-enter in a call and response sequence gently and beautifully accompanied by glissandi in harps and an upper pedal (B) on 1st Violins</p>
<p>The work concludes with voices repeating two chords which become quieter and quieter</p>
