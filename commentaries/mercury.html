<p>Mercury is marked Vivace (very lively) in the compound time signature of 6/8 in Bflat major</p>
<p>Mercury the Winged Messenger</p>
<p>Note <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#1726">the strings are muted</a></p>
<p>This movement was inspired by Mercury the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(mythology)">Roman god of communication and prosperity</a>. Mercury is also associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(astrology)">Gemini</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(astrology)">Virgo</a></p>
<p>The pulse is staying the same but rhythmic <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#1732">ambiguity is beginning to be established</a></p>
<p>The visuals here needed energy and movement to match the music, so Mercury is shown zooming around, presumably delivering messages</p>

<p>Mercury’s direction matches the music: if the pitch ascends, so does Mercury</p>
<p>Section concludes with <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#1757">1st violins on a high harmonic</a></p>
<p>We used to think that Mercury did not spin and always faced the Sun, but that’s not true.</p>
<p>1st violins using natural harmonic E play a <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#1801">rhythmic motif</a></p>
<p>Can you hear Morse code? Maybe Mercury is trasnmitting messages to alien worlds?</p>
<p>Rhythmic motif transferred to Glockenspiel</p>
<p><a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#1838">Rhythmic accompaniment</a> presented solidly in 2/4 with melody on solo violin in 6/8</p>
<p>The motion through a star field is used here because it suggests a journey, and the motion gives the image sufficient energy to match the music</p>
<p>Places on Mercury have the greatest temperature range in the Solar System: -280 to 800F</p>
<p>2nd violins begin the <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#1905">building of the orchestral texture</a></p>
<p>As the energy level in the music builds so does the drama and speed shown on screen</p>
<p>Here comes the crescendo - wait for it</p>
<p>And as we pass through the apex everything slows down. Notice the lighting emphasizes the downbeat</p>

<p>Despite being close to the Sun, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/water-ice-on-mercury">water ice</a> has been detected in shadowed craters</p>
<p>For the closing section new imagery is shown at a fast pace to match the energy in the music</p>

<p>In 2021 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BepiColombo">BepiColombo</a> mission will arrive at Mercury</p>
<p>When the music calms it’s important that the imagery becomes calm and/or smaller, so a zoom out fits well</p>
<p>A melody that descends in pitch goes well with a zoom-out too</p>
<p><a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#2141">A chromatic ascent</a> through the range of the woodwind family</p>
<p>The penultimate bar is a <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#2156">held close harmony Emajor Chord</a></p>
<p>arked Vivace (very lively) in the compound time signature of 6/8 in Bflat major</p>
<p>The strings are muted and Holst creates a very delicate texture of perpetually mobile eighth notes, passing the motion from one string family and woodwind family member to another, underpinned by short chords in harps</p>
<p>Two bars of 2/4 using sixteenth notes in strings and woodwind, followed by a return to 6/8 followed by 2/4 again. The pulse staying the same but rhythmic ambiguity beginning to be established</p>
<p>Piccolo in 6/8 whilst oboes, celeste, harp 1 and 1st violin in 3/4</p>
<p>Section concludes with 1st violins on a high harmonic (violins simply rest their finger on the string rather than pressing it down, producing a very airy light sound)</p>
<p>1st violins using natural harmonic E play a rhythmic motif, which is completely rhythmically ambiguous between 3/4 and 6/8. This acts as an upper pedal (same as a low pedal - sustaining harmonic direction)</p>
<p>Rhythmic motif transferred to Glockenspiel</p>
<p>Rhythmic accompaniment presented solidly in 2/4 with melody on solo violin in 6/8, proceeded by solo oboe, flute and celeste. The celeste is accompanied by just one desk (two players) per 1st Violins 2nd violins and violas</p>
<p>2nd violins begin the building of the orchestral texture followed by 1st violins, clarinets, flutes and trumpets all accompanied with chords in brass and arpeggiation in harps in Cmajor</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermata">fermata (pause)</a> on a low Bflat and F followed by one bar return to the opening rhythmic idea and another fermata bar, followed by a complete return to the opening material - a recapitulation</p>
<p>The next section is full of rhythmic ambiguity in which the original idea is tossed around the orchestra in combinations of 6/8, 3/4 and 2/4. Particularly listen out for the celeste and piccolo duet in 6/8 accompanied by strings, harp and woodwind in 3/4</p>
<p>Strings in rhythmic unison played pianissimo in Dmajor with a weirdly meandering melodic profile where the material goes one way then the next</p>
<p>Woodwinds join, dropping the tonality by half a step to Dflat major</p>
<p>A descending phrase in flutes and clarinets phrased in 4 notes rather than the previous 3 creating yet more rhythmic ambiguity</p>
<p>Strings in rhythmic unison make a hushed return but in a more harmonically ambiguous way, using a variety of chromatic notes. With the joining of the woodwind this leads to a very brief orchestral climax on a single eighth note of Emajor</p>
<p>The ambiguous rhythmic motif returns on timpani on the apparent dominant (B), with interjections by celeste and woodwind and the original melody played by piccolo and solo violin</p>
<p>A chromatic ascent through the range of the woodwind family in 2/4 concluding on a very high E harmonic (4 octaves above middle 'c') played by 1st violins with further interjections from celeste, strings, harp contra bassoon and double bass</p>
