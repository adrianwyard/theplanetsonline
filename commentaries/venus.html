<p>Venus provides a welcome reprise after the onslaught of war; peace and harmony are restored. This movement finds Holst at his most lyrical</p>

<p>Venus (aka 'The Evening Star') is bright because it is shrouded in reflective clouds</p>
<p>While Holst titled this movement 'The bringer of peace,' Venus is traditionally also associated with love. The visuals for this movement loosely depicts a romantic relationship</p>

<p>Marked Adagio (Slow) in Eflat Major (3 flats) with no expression markings</p>
<p>The movement opens with a solo french horn playing a beautifully simply rising melody. Almost exactly the same tune as the opening of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(Weber)">Opera Oberon</a> by Weber</p>
<p>A beautiful answer to the melody in a choir of 4 flutes and 3 oboes moving in contrary motion (flutes going down and oboes going up). The second time this is heard the oboes are replaced by clarinets retaining the original contrary motion</p>
<p>Holst enables the orchestra to glitter and dazzle with the inclusion of two harps, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glockenspiel">glockenspiel</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celesta">celeste</a>. A celeste is a very novel addition to the orchestra. It is a keyboard instrument sounding an octave higher than written consisting of small bells hit by tiny mallets. Again at this point we hear a typical Holst idea of moving chromatically altered chords (harps, horns and flutes), over a pedal note. The pedals move downward by half step played by double basses and cello</p>
<p>Main theme returns on solo french horn maintaining the notion of ever present peace and serenity. with the contrary motion answering phrase in flutes and clarinets</p>
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio">arpeggiated</a> lower string passage leading to an enharmonic cadence of a Dflat 7 chord moving to an Fsharp major chord. If we read the first chord as Csharp major 7 and the second as Fsharp major, this is beautiful perfect cadence, moving into the dazzling brightness of Fsharp</p>
<p>The violin solo is accompanied by a close harmony <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncopation">syncopated</a> oboe choir followed by unison violins playing this second melody</p>
<p>New violin melody for all violins in the orchestra, accompanied by a close harmony syncopated choir of oboes, cor anglais (english horn - a low oboe, clarinets and horn, proceeded by a solo oboe playing the same melody accompanied by a choir of flutes</p>
<p>Solo violin returns accompanied by a syncopated choir of flutes in their low tessitura (range)</p>
<p>A solo oboe takes a new version of the melody dropping a semitone to Fmajor from Fsharp major. This melody superimposed with an earlier melodic fragment concluding with a passionate version played by strings followed by solo cello</p>
<p>Listen out for a version of the original melody several octaves lower in the cellos and double bass reintroducing the original glittering orchestration with the use of 2 harps and celeste, maintaining the idea of chromatically altered chords with pedal notes (in Eflat with a dominant pedal of Bflat)</p>
<p>Strings are muted (a rubber clip is attached to the bridge muffling the sound) with only 4 desks of 1st Violins and 4 desks of 2nd violins accompanying the main theme played by flute. 1st and 2nd violins are in contrary motion</p>
<p>Muted violin theme returns accompanied by a flute choir in Fflat major (enharmonically Emajor) proceeded by a horn and cello solo using the same melodic material</p>
<p>Return to the home key of Eflat major with sparkling orchestration including scalic figures on harps and celeste as well as beautiful arppegiated accompaniment figures in Harp 1, clarinet and flutes followed by violins</p>
<p>Contrary motion in Flutes and Horns colored with the use of harp harmonics (plucked at certain parts of the string - they sound an octave higher than written giving a very pure floating sound). Celeste has the main rhythmic and melodic movement, the rest of the orchestra accompanies very quietly</p>
<p>Harp 2 provides a shimmering tremolo (fast oscillation on the same note). In this case an Eflat and Dsharp. They are played on different strings on the harp and hence can do a rapid oscillation - a classic Holst orchestral coloring effect</p>
<p>Violins are subdivided into 4 separate parts very high in their range producing an ethereal effect as if floating on the final chord. The final chord of eflat is left floating and the celeste adds a final C effectively making it a Cmin seventh, hence the apparent lack of resolution</p>
