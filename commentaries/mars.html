<p>The Planets was written by British composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Holst">Gustav Holst</a></p>
<p>Mars is marked Allegro (lively) in 5/4 with no expression marks, in Cmajor</p>
<p>Mars the Bringer of War</p>
<p>Mars begins with the <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#13">angular and irregular meter of 5/4</a></p>
<p>Holst's main inspiration was the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planets_in_astrology">the planets in mythology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planets_in_astrology">astrology</a></p>

<p>The final 8 measures are marked <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#0757">Rallentando al Fine</a> (slowing to the end)</p>
<p>The synchronized lighting really adds to the force of this conclusion</p>
<p>Mars begins with the angular and irregular meter of 5/4 (5 beats per measure). As western listeners we are programmed to be comfortable in 2 or 3 or 4 beats per measure. 5 beats immediately gives the sense of being uneasy and mechanistic.</p>
<p>The first fragment of melody enters with very low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassoon">bassoons</a> plus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrabassoon">contra bassoon</a> and horn. The melody consists of a perfect 5th followed by a half step (semi-tone). It lasts for 20 beats or 4 measures. </p>
<p>Listen out for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(music)#Changes">crescendo and immediate diminuendo</a> across two measures</p>
<p>The full 1st theme appears passed up through the woodwind families – bassoons – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_clarinet">bass clarinet</a> – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_oboe">bass oboe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cor_anglais">english horn (Cor Anglais)</a> to oboe. It consists of a rising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth">perfect fifth</a> followed by a semitone slide downwards, followed by another perfect 5th rise and another semitone slide downward. A very angular melodic shape.</p>
<p>A Dflat chord over a G pedal. This creates a very unsettling dissonance. In addition the horns are asked to play the notes stopped (the muting of the note with the hand in the bell) and the trumpet with a mute. This creates a snarling and rasping effect</p>
<p>The movement is dominated by an incessant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato">ostinato</a> (repeating pattern) of triplet, two quarters, two eighth’s and a quarter note. Holst’s orchestration (use of instruments) is remarkably novel with emphasis most definitely on the brutal and mechanistic. He uses the combination of unison (all playing the same thing), strings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_legno">Col Legno</a> (with the wood of the Bow), two harps in their low register, timpani using wooden sticks and a very quiet roll (p) on gong/tam tam.</p>
<p>Listen out for the strings returning to 'naturale' or with the use of the hair of the bow. This makes the combined sound of the string section much louder</p>
<p>The first entry of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphonium">tenor tuba</a>, which begins the fanfares in the brass, leading to a major orchestral climax 5 bars later. The tenor tuba is a non-conventional orchestral instrument, more at home in a Brass Band, where it's called a Baritone</p>
<p>First major climax. The opening pedal G of this movement or the Dominant has finally moved to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_(music)">Tonic</a> of C. On top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato">ostinato</a> is a raw and dissonant Dflat major chord played by full woodwind, horns and trumpets</p>
<p>The second theme makes its first appearance. A legato chromatic theme with just one single note articulated staccato. It first appears on trombones and tenor tuba and then passed to horns and trumpets. The ostinato remains in full strings trumpet and timpani</p>
<p>An orchestral climax where the music abruptly begins in Eflat minor. The full orchestral texture is replaced by stabbing quarters in the strings using down-bow retakes (where the string player plays a down bow stroke lifts the bow of the string and plays another down bow stroke). This gives a very brutal and ugly effect</p>
<p>A duet between tenor tuba and trumpets. It is a militaristic fanfare in a call and response manner. This is repeated using fuller orchestral textures in the proceeding bars before returning to the duet between tenor tuba and trumpets with the inclusion of a military drum (snare drum) as if calling each other across the battlefield</p>
<p>The fanfares are accompanied by very fast scurrying chromatic string and woodwind lines underpinned by an Aminor Chord with superimposed dissonances of Fsharp and Gsharp in the horns and trombone. This leads to a massive held chord of the same notes as previous - a huge dissonance! Listen out for the organ - an ultra low pedal G</p>
<p>The music shifts from 5 quarters in a bar to 5 half notes and we hear the second chromatic melodic idea in augmentation (doubling of length) on low strings, bassoons and contra bassoon. The snare drum provides fragments of the original ostinato. The orchestral texture grows and crescendos in a very menacing way</p>
<p>The whole orchestra (Tutti) play the opening ostinato triple fortissimo (as loud as you can)</p>
<p>The trumpets, timpani and side drum hammer out the ostinato incessantly whilst the rest of the orchestra plays the first angular theme</p>
<p>Trombones enter playing the militaristic call and response melody accompanied by the original ostinato in strings, at the heel of the bow (at the bass end of the bow to give the most sound and edge to the notes)</p>
<p>The fanfare is interspersed with the chromatic theme in woodwind all still over the pounding ostinato in strings</p>
<p>Listen out for the entry of the organ on the 4th and 5th beats of the measure</p>
<p>A massive climax in augmented time of 5/2 (5 half notes per bar) of two unrelated perfect 5ths piled on top of each other - C/G with Dflat/Aflat</p>
<p>Music returns to quarter not measures in 3/4 with the return of the scurrying chromatic string and woodwind motif</p>
<p>The final 8 measures are marked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo#Terms_for_change_in_tempo">Rallentando</a> al Fine (slowing to the end). Holst refers back to the original ostinato and uses fragments pulling everything back to a grinding halt. The final note is an explosive and violent open 5th (C/G) using strings, percussion, brass and bassoons</p>
