<p>Uranus the Magician</p>
<p>The opening theme is presented as <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#4139">a series of 4 Fermatas (pauses)</a></p>
<p>This movement was inspired by Uranus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_(mythology)">a Greek sky god</a>. Uranus is also associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(astrology)">Aquarius</a></p>
<p>Uranus makes a bold entrance, as most magicians do</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus#Name">name Uranus</a> was not finally settled until the 1830s</p>

<p>Again, twinkling stars keep the image alive in this very quiet section</p>
<p>Marked Allegro in 6/4 divided into dotted half beat notes in Cmajor</p>
<p>The opening theme is presented as a series of 4 seemingly unrelated held notes or Fermatas (pauses) G - Eflat - A - B. This is answered by the same pitches in diminution played by tenor tuba and tuba. This is followed by further rhythmic diminution of the theme played by timpani</p>
<p>The dance begins in a gnarly way using solo bassoons, in a very similar manner to Dukas in The Sorcerers Apprentice. The orchestral textures build and thicken with the inclusion of more and more instrumental families</p>
<p>Holst increases tension by increasing the density of notes per half measure from 3 to 4 - increasing speed without the alteration of pulse</p>
<p>Holst uses rhythmic ambiguity with 6/4 in trumpets and 3/2 in tubas</p>
<p>Use of rhythmic ambiguity with strings in 3/2 and woodwind in 6/4</p>
<p>Theme 2 is presented by unison strings and horns accompanied by woodwind and lower strings with single notes on beats 3 and 6</p>
<p>Return of the main theme played by bassoon and bass clarinet with a rhythmic diminution for timpani and further rhythmic augmentation for tuba</p>
<p>Main theme set in 3/2 as apposed to 6/4 played by timpani and tuba followed by the theme played very quickly in eighth notes by piccolo, flute and clarinet concluding with the original theme in the original note lengths</p>
<p>The dance starts again with a complex accompaniment played by bass woodwind instruments, timpani, 2 harps and lower strings</p>
<p>Theme 3 is first heard by tenor tuba and tuba. The phrases are extended to include 9/4 bars concluding with the opening theme in diminution on timpani</p>
<p>Theme 3 played by trumpets using straight quarter note rhythms with woodwind interjections of theme one in eighth notes</p>
<p>Huge orchestral rallentando (slowing down) leading to a massive strike on the bass drum and cymbal and the return of theme 3 with extended phrases in 9/4 with main theme in diminution</p>
<p>Final rallentando with a glissando (rapid ascending scale with the hand drawn across the manual), on the organ along the full length of the manual</p>
<p>Homophonic string chords using just 2 desks of strings with the main theme played by 1st harp using harmonics</p>
<p>Timpani play the main theme in continuing rhythmic diminution until the main theme returns in half notes in strings, brass percussion and woodwind</p>
<p>Full orchestral dissonance using a bi-tonal chord of Fmajor and Cminor with a pedal E</p>
<p>Final fragment of the main theme played by 1st Harp with harmonics and two final ambiguous chords of open fifths</p>
