As western listeners we are programmed to be comfortable in 2 or 3 or 4 beats per measure. 5 beats immediately gives the sense of being uneasy and mechanistic.</p><p>The first fragment of melody enters with very low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassoon">bassoons</a> plus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrabassoon">contra bassoon</a> and horn. The melody consists of a perfect 5th followed by a half step (semi-tone). It lasts for 20 beats or 4 measures. </p><p>Listen out for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(music)#Changes">crescendo and immediate diminuendo</a> across two measures</p><p>The full 1st theme appears passed up through the woodwind families – bassoons – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_clarinet">bass clarinet</a> – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_oboe">bass oboe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cor_anglais">english horn (Cor Anglais)</a> to oboe. It consists of a rising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth">perfect fifth</a> followed by a semitone slide downwards, followed by another perfect 5th rise and another semitone slide downward. A very angular melodic shape.</p><p>A Dflat chord over a G pedal. This creates a very unsettling dissonance. In addition the horns are asked to play the notes stopped (the muting of the note with the hand in the bell) and the trumpet with a mute. This creates a snarling and rasping effect</p><p>The movement is dominated by an incessant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato">ostinato</a> (repeating pattern) of triplet, two quarters, two eighth’s and a quarter note. Holst’s orchestration (use of instruments) is remarkably novel with emphasis most definitely on the brutal and mechanistic. He uses the combination of unison (all playing the same thing), strings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_legno">Col Legno</a> (with the wood of the Bow), two harps in their low register, timpani using wooden sticks and a very quiet roll (p) on gong/tam tam.</p><p>Listen out for the strings returning to 'naturale' or with the use of the hair of the bow. This makes the combined sound of the string section much louder</p><p>The first entry of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphonium">tenor tuba</a>, which begins the fanfares in the brass, leading to a major orchestral climax 5 bars later. The tenor tuba is a non-conventional orchestral instrument, more at home in a Brass Band, where it's called a Baritone</p><p>First major climax. The opening pedal G of this movement or the Dominant has finally moved to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_(music)">Tonic</a> of C. On top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato">ostinato</a> is a raw and dissonant Dflat major chord played by full woodwind, horns and trumpets</p><p>The second theme makes its first appearance. A legato chromatic theme with just one single note articulated staccato. It first appears on trombones and tenor tuba and then passed to horns and trumpets. The ostinato remains in full strings trumpet and timpani</p><p>An orchestral climax where the music abruptly begins in Eflat minor. The full orchestral texture is replaced by stabbing quarters in the strings using down-bow retakes (where the string player plays a down bow stroke lifts the bow of the string and plays another down bow stroke). This gives a very brutal and ugly effect</p><p>A duet between tenor tuba and trumpets. It is a militaristic fanfare in a call and response manner. This is repeated using fuller orchestral textures in the proceeding bars before returning to the duet between tenor tuba and trumpets with the inclusion of a military drum (snare drum) as if calling each other across the battlefield</p><p>The fanfares are accompanied by very fast scurrying chromatic string and woodwind lines underpinned by an Aminor Chord with superimposed dissonances of Fsharp and Gsharp in the horns and trombone. This leads to a massive held chord of the same notes as previous - a huge dissonance! Listen out for the organ - an ultra low pedal G</p><p>The music shifts from 5 quarters in a bar to 5 half notes and we hear the second chromatic melodic idea in augmentation (doubling of length) on low strings, bassoons and contra bassoon. The snare drum provides fragments of the original ostinato. The orchestral texture grows and crescendos in a very menacing way</p><p>The whole orchestra (Tutti) play the opening ostinato triple fortissimo (as loud as you can)</p><p>The trumpets, timpani and side drum hammer out the ostinato incessantly whilst the rest of the orchestra plays the first angular theme</p><p>Trombones enter playing the militaristic call and response melody accompanied by the original ostinato in strings, at the heel of the bow (at the bass end of the bow to give the most sound and edge to the notes)</p><p>The fanfare is interspersed with the chromatic theme in woodwind all still over the pounding ostinato in strings</p><p>Listen out for the entry of the organ on the 4th and 5th beats of the measure</p><p>A massive climax in augmented time of 5/2 (5 half notes per bar) of two unrelated perfect 5ths piled on top of each other - C/G with Dflat/Aflat</p><p>Music returns to quarter not measures in 3/4 with the return of the scurrying chromatic string and woodwind motif</p><p>The final 8 measures are marked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo#Terms_for_change_in_tempo">Rallentando</a> al Fine (slowing to the end). Holst refers back to the original ostinato and uses fragments pulling everything back to a grinding halt. The final note is an explosive and violent open 5th (C/G) using strings, percussion, brass and bassoons</p><!-- Venus --><p>Venus is marked Adagio (Slow) in Eflat Major (3 flats) with no expression markings</p><p>Venus the Bringer of Peace</p><p>The movement opens with a <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#0839">solo french horn</a></p><p>Venus provides a welcome reprise after the onslaught of war; peace and harmony are restored. This movement finds Holst at his most lyrical</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_Venus">Missions to Venus</a></p><p>A beautiful <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#0849">answer to the melody</a> in a choir of 4 flutes and 3 oboes</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus">Venus - the cloud planet</a> (<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>) </p><p>Venus (aka 'The Evening Star') is bright because it is shrouded in reflective clouds</p><p>While Holst titled this movement 'The bringer of peace,' Venus is traditionally also associated with love.

Almost exactly the same tune as the opening of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(Weber)">Opera Oberon</a> by Weber</p><p>A beautiful answer to the melody in a choir of 4 flutes and 3 oboes moving in contrary motion (flutes going down and oboes going up). The second time this is heard the oboes are replaced by clarinets retaining the original contrary motion</p><p>Holst enables the orchestra to glitter and dazzle with the inclusion of two harps, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glockenspiel">glockenspiel</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celesta">celeste</a>. A celeste is a very novel addition to the orchestra. It is a keyboard instrument sounding an octave higher than written consisting of small bells hit by tiny mallets. Again at this point we hear a typical Holst idea of moving chromatically altered chords (harps, horns and flutes), over a pedal note. The pedals move downward by half step played by double basses and cello</p><p>Main theme returns on solo french horn maintaining the notion of ever present peace and serenity. with the contrary motion answering phrase in flutes and clarinets</p><p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio">arpeggiated</a> lower string passage leading to an enharmonic cadence of a Dflat 7 chord moving to an Fsharp major chord. If we read the first chord as Csharp major 7 and the second as Fsharp major, this is beautiful perfect cadence, moving into the dazzling brightness of Fsharp</p><p>The violin solo is accompanied by a close harmony <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncopation">syncopated</a> oboe choir followed by unison violins playing this second melody</p><p>New violin melody for all violins in the orchestra, accompanied by a close harmony syncopated choir of oboes, cor anglais (english horn - a low oboe, clarinets and horn, proceeded by a solo oboe playing the same melody accompanied by a choir of flutes</p><p>Solo violin returns accompanied by a syncopated choir of flutes in their low tessitura (range)</p><p>A solo oboe takes a new version of the melody dropping a semitone to Fmajor from Fsharp major. This melody superimposed with an earlier melodic fragment concluding with a passionate version played by strings followed by solo cello</p><p>Listen out for a version of the original melody several octaves lower in the cellos and double bass reintroducing the original glittering orchestration with the use of 2 harps and celeste, maintaining the idea of chromatically altered chords with pedal notes (in Eflat with a dominant pedal of Bflat)</p><p>Strings are muted (a rubber clip is attached to the bridge muffling the sound) with only 4 desks of 1st Violins and 4 desks of 2nd violins accompanying the main theme played by flute. 1st and 2nd violins are in contrary motion</p><p>Muted violin theme returns accompanied by a flute choir in Fflat major (enharmonically Emajor) proceeded by a horn and cello solo using the same melodic material</p><p>Return to the home key of Eflat major with sparkling orchestration including scalic figures on harps and celeste as well as beautiful arppegiated accompaniment figures in Harp 1, clarinet and flutes followed by violins</p><p>Contrary motion in Flutes and Horns colored with the use of harp harmonics (plucked at certain parts of the string - they sound an octave higher than written giving a very pure floating sound). Celeste has the main rhythmic and melodic movement, the rest of the orchestra accompanies very quietly</p><p>Harp 2 provides a shimmering tremolo (fast oscillation on the same note).
