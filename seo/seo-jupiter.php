<p>Jupiter is marked Allegro Giocoso (joyfully lively) in Cmajor in 2/4</p>
<p>Jupiter the Bringer of Jollity</p>
<p>Opening texture is formed out of <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#2209">four three-note patterns</a></p>
<p>This movement was inpired by Jupiter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)">the king of the Roman gods</a>. Jupiter is also associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(astrology)">Sagittarius</a></p>
<p>The first theme is a highly <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#2214">syncopated jaunty melody</a></p>
<p>A big image for bold music that depicts a big, bold planet!</p>

<p>Cymbals always indicate an event of some kind - here it’s the introduction of Jupiter’s moon, Io</p>
<p>The second melody with its <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#2240">fanfare qualities</a> is played by 4 unison french horns</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callisto_(moon)">Here's Jupiter's moon Callisto</a> (<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>) </p>

<p>Where did they go? Jupiter is a prankster</p>
<p>The third theme is another highly jaunty melody played by <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#2320">strings and horns</a></p>
<p>The third themes second quotation uses full woodwind with a sprinkling of glockenspiel</p>

<p>As mentioned before a crescendo with cymbals needs a dramatic event. Here we show a high-speed zoom out from Jupiter’s Red Spot</p>

<p>The fanfare second theme is <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#2518">accompanied by a novel and exceptionally rapid pizzicato</a></p>
<p>Fifth Theme - in Eflat major, <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#2538">reminiscent of an English Hymn tune</a></p>
<p>Down we go to Europa's cracked surface</p>
<p>Majestic hymn-like music needs an appropriately majestic scene</p>

<p>Europa gets stretched by 100ft every three days. This is caused by Jupiter’s enormous gravity</p>
<p>And a concluding melody needs a concluding, slowing image</p>

<p>Return of the waltz theme in Dflat major in 3/4</p>
<p>Return of the English Hymn Fifth theme <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#3027">in all lower instruments</a></p>
<p>Presto (very fast) tempo <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#3050">using the original three note texture</a></p>
<p>Listen out for the final chord (Cmajor) - it's the only note for Bass Drum in the movement</p>
<p>Marked Allegro Giocoso (joyfully lively) in Cmajor in 2/4</p>
<p>Opening texture is formed out of four three-note patterns superimposed over one another played by 1st and 2nd violins</p>
<p>The first theme is a highly syncopated jaunty melody played by 6 horns cellos and violas in unison followed by an orchestral crescendo using the previous three note patterns</p>
<p>The main theme is re-stated using a unique combination of instruments. The melody is played completely by a double set of timpani. In order to play all the melody's notes Holst has to spread the tune across two sets of timpani. In addition Holst uses double basses, tuba, tenor tuba, and bassoons</p>
<p>The second melody with its fanfare qualities is played by 4 unison french horns followed by another highly syncopated answering phrase played by strings, clarinets and bassoons. The following section is an inter-play of theme two and the opening three note texture played by 3 flutes and piccolo</p>
<p>The third theme is another highly jaunty melody played by strings and horns in unison accompanied by a traditional umm-pah pattern in double basses, tuba and trombones</p>
<p>The third themes second quotation uses full woodwind with a sprinkling of glockenspiel</p>
<p>A return to first theme in closed three part harmony in violins and violas, interspersed with the three note opening texture and theme 2 (fanfares)</p>
<p>First quotation of the 4th theme played by french horns in unison in which Holst uses a waltz as his medium for Jollity - in 3/4, followed by strings and woodwind reiterating the melody</p>
<p>The waltz theme is played by trumpets in octaves accompanied by arpeggiated woodwind lines and the first appearance of a tambourine</p>
<p>The waltz gathers tempo through a stringendo (meaning to get quicker), and Holst combines the 4th melody with the syncopated 1st melody played by trombones</p>
<p>The waltz reaches a Fsharp major climax followed by a fanfare from brass using the rhythm of the first theme followed by timpani using a fragment from the same source in 2/4</p>
<p>The fanfare second theme is accompanied by a novel and exceptionally rapid pizzicato (plucking of the string) in violas and cellos</p>
<p>Fifth Theme - in Eflat major, reminiscent of an English Hymn tune - used later for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Vow_to_Thee,_My_Country">'I vow to thee my Country'</a>; perhaps more in the style of Edward Elgar?</p>
<p>Return to the fanfare second theme played by cor anglais accompanied by rapidly repeated two note patterns in first and second violins, followed by upper strings tremolando (rapid movement of the bow at the point on one note)</p>
<p>Return to first theme on oboe in Amajor</p>
<p>An abrupt return to the opening theme played fortissimo</p>
<p>Listen out for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_mark">comma or luftpause</a> before the return of the third theme (general pause on the upbeat)</p>
<p>Return of the waltz theme in Dflat major in 3/4</p>
<p>Return of the English Hymn Fifth theme in all lower instruments accompanied by ascending and descending scales in harp and woodwind in the key of Bmajor. Upper strings play arpeggiated ten notes to a quarter. The section concludes with a rising chromatic scale in strings and lower wind</p>
<p>Presto (very fast) tempo using the original three note texture in upper strings and wind with final quotation of a rhythmic fragment from the opening theme played by trombones and double timpani</p>
