<p><a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17172">Saturn in Silhouette</a> (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a>/<a href="https://jpl.nasa.gov">JPL</a>/<a href="https://www.spacescience.org">SSI</a>) </p>
<p>This silhouette makes Saturns rings look almost like a halo - the final conclusion to old age</p>
<p>The music <a href="./pages/musiccomp.html#4038">becomes more static</a> and the harmonic rhythm slows even further</p>
<p>Marked Adagio (Very Slow) with 4 beats per measure with no expression markings</p>
<p>The opening begins on the second quarter with a unique combination of 2 flutes, bass flute and low harp harmonics giving a very pale color to the sound. The rhythmic pattern in syncopated with chords sounding on the second and fourth beats of every measure. The tonality is ambiguous with no really defined key centre</p>
<p>Opening melody played by the double bass section three octaves lower than the accompaniment</p>
<p>This opening melody is now played by the bass oboe. This is a very rare and novel inclusion within the orchestra. In Germanic music it is known as a Heckelphone, an instrument loved by Richard Strauss</p>
<p>The beginning of the trombone close harmony choral as a type of cortege accompanied by pizzicato lower strings in Emajor</p>
<p>Cortege continues with accompaniment on beats 2 and 4 with timpani, harps and lower strings pizzicato. A chorus of flutes and bass flute on the beat plays the main theme</p>
<p>The orchestral textures thicken until the pulse doubles (animato) and the motion of the music is syncopated across the quarter and eighth notes. This is the first time that tubular bells are used in the piece as an offbeat peel. The tempo oscillates between this new tempo and the original tempo with terrifying effect</p>
<p>The music returns to being ambiguous and the positioning of the pulses becomes vague resulting in the inaudibility of the bar lines and sense of floating</p>
<p>The main theme is played by a solo double bass and appears to float as the bar lines have in-effect vanished due to the syncopated accompaniment in harp harmonics</p>
<p>The main theme is played by bass clarinet and bassoons accompanied by a choir of syncopated flutes and harp</p>
<p>The main theme is played pp (pianissimo) by unison strings accompanied by an overlaying of textures including 16th notes by harps a lattice work of french horn entries, arrpegiated flutes and tubular bells</p>
<p>Main theme transferred to trombones</p>
<p>Main theme given back to unison strings (bar double basses) raised one octave</p>
<p>The music becomes more static and the harmonic rhythm slows even further. Holst includes very low pedals from the very limits of the range of the organ. Movement ends with an endless sustained Cmajor chord in upper strings</p>
